# HelloDoc
First stab at GitHub Pages for project documentation.

I have set the publish source to branch gh-pages.

I chose a theme in Jekyll Theme Chooser.

In my repo options, it says my site is ready to be published. Not sure how to publish, so I am modifying the readme.md and will push the change to see if that publishes.
